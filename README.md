A face controlled musical instrument


# Describe how it is innovative (up to 500 characters) *

Only very recently has the technology to do this kind of realtime motion tracking cmaterialised and that is due to innovations in machine learning and improvements in computer graphics processers.

The tool has been designed to be used with the Looking Glass portrait holographic display which is the world's first consumer grade 3D display. 

And if i'm not trying to avoid using buzz words here, this project is in fact an augmented reality, real time motion capture, machine-learning powered, holographic, acessible general MIDI controller and synthesizer. 


# What is the most inspiring use of your entry (up to 500 characters)? *
I have been developing and researching accessible technology for twenty years and for the past 10 have been helping run a monthly workshop alongside the Drake Music Charity that brings together people who struggle to play traditional instruments, and technology focussed indivuals who know how to build and make things. The charity work directly alongside schools and individuals and offers   use cases and real world feedback - indispensable when simplicity is the aim. Together we have created a whole number of accessible musical instrments, some that are repurposing of existing instruments and some entirely new. My focus for the past few years has been to try and create musical instruments / music creation tools with the lowest barriers to entry, that everybody can play instinctively and that are easy to obtain and are fun to play too! Currently the only requirement to play is a mouth, but that could be swapped for eyes or eyebrows, the technology is quite giving. 

Ultimately, this tool allows *all* sorts of people to create their own sounds and music.



# Do you have plans for expansion and commercialisation (up to 500 characters)?

Plans for expansion would be to create an app version that would allow it to run smoother on mobile devices. I think this would be key to getting it onto everybody's devices. The app stores offer retail opportunities. 

Plans for commercialisation would revolve around the application version that could include monetisation from expansion packs and even a paid for pro version. For development to continue there would have to be a certain level of income but licensing is certainly an option in that respect.

Already there are plans for a recording looper and effects but the full magnitude of the project would ideally be suggested by user cases rather than frivolous complexity in an attempt to streamline the simplicity and minimize development costs.


# Give examples of how your entry connects with other MIDI devices or software

Can be used as a controller for other hardware MIDI devices and in duet mode allows 2 people to independently control individual MIDI channels in realtime together. 

In single player mode, the MIDI events currently get broadcast to all channels.

The prototype has only basic note on / note off MIDI interaction but I would like to add after touch and pitch bending to the interface, perhaps eye brow control? 

I would also like to develop certain different modes - an expressive mode which works in direct relation with facial movements (as it currently works), and a more fun but equally satisfying pop music factory mode where the mouth controls the next playback and amplitude of the next phrase in a sequence (loaded from a MIDI file) whilst a backing track supports you. 

Given enough time it would be possible to save MIDI files directly from the app too, turning it into a rudimentary face controlled DAW.


# Is your entry a commercialised product? * Please explain

Not currently (I have even open sourced it on github) but it has applications that certainly could be and I would love to be able to fund further development as although a one off holographic prototype will be made for use inside the forthcoming Accessible Musical Instrument Collection museum in London, there is no reason that it could not be commercialised and expanded into a more professional commercial product. The technology is very interesting and my prototype doesn't do justice to the real possibilities (neither visually or sonically) but I hope it illustrates the concept I have in mind and the potential of this approach.
