Welcome to the PhotoSynth
Smile at the screen FOR SUPER POWERS!


Roll your head left and right to change the note
Tilt your head forwards and backwards to change octave

Then open you mouth to make it louder!
Change instruments by closing both eyes for 1 bar
or by tapping your face on screen
to select an instrument from a list
hold your finger on your face for one bar to see all instruments
Facing left plays the black keys
Facing right plays the white keys
Use your eyes to shape the sound
Connect a MIDI instrument and click the MIDI button
In order to play the MIDI instrument with your head
You can change tempo using the arrow keys
Or just type a 3 digit number to set a BPM
Or tap the x key in rhythm a few times
