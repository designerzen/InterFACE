# MIDI.js Soundfonts

[MIDI.js](https://github.com/mudcube/MIDI.js) is a fantastic library for MIDI sequencing and playback in Javascript. It comes packaged with a [soundfont-generator](https://github.com/mudcube/MIDI.js/blob/master/soundfont-generator/ruby/soundfont_builder.rb) that is unfortuantely a little difficult to get up and running (requires installation of Ruby, Node.js, FluidSynth, Lame, etc.)

This project contains pre-rendered [General MIDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_MIDI) soundfonts that can be used immediately with MIDI.js.
