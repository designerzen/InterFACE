// Originally I had planned on using this to extract
// the licenses from JS and pt them into anchor links
// but having read the licenses deeper, I don't
// think legally I am allowed to do that so instead
// 300k of license data is loaded and hidden in scripts!

// The LICENSE.md files are created by a package.json script
// that calls a yarn command
